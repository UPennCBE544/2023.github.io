For the Final Project, you will be studying ethylene carbonate adosrption on Lithium Cobalt Oxide (LiCoO<sub>2</sub>) with different dopant metals. Each group will be assigned a metal dopant to work with (see list of Assigned Projects). The students will work in groups of two or three on the same dopant to perform calculations individually, however, complementing each other. Each pair of students will present their results in class that will be critiqued by the other groups. Finally, each group  will jointly write a final report on the combined data. The due date for the final written report is <font color="red">5/8 at 5:00 PM (hard deadline)</font>.

Please make use of the [Piazza](https://piazza.com/) page for troubleshooting, discussions and for sharing results.

## Introduction ##

Goal: Understand how different metal dopants affect the structure and reactivity of LiCoO2 specifically through the adsorption of ethylene carbonate (EC).

Plan: Use DFT to study dopant effects on structure and changes it causes to EC adsorption on the surface of LiCoO2. Study the electronic structure of LiCoO2 and doped LiCoO2 to see if any trends exist.

### Motivation ###

LiMO<sub>2</sub> (M= Co, Mn, Ni) materials are the most common cathode materials in batteries today. LiCoO2 is by far the most popular of those materials. A combination of effects has lead to investigations to attempt to improve the stability of LiCoO2 cathode materials or find suitable alternatives. Some problems include cost, reactivity, and structural problems that occur during cycling. Decomposition of the liquid electrolyte is a common cause of decreased battery performance. Ethylene carbonate is a popular component of the elctrolyte solution in Li ion batteries. In order to improve battery performance critical importance in improving battery operation is understanding the electrode â€“ electrolyte interface. For high capacity battery materials, electrolytes decomposed causing the battery to decrease in performance.

AIP Conference Proceedings 1597, 26 (2014); https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4878478 Published Online: 17 February 2015

Ongoing work in the [Cabana Group](https://cabana.chem.uic.edu/) at UIC has shown that some metal dopants, specifically Al in LiCoO<sub>2</sub> can increase the lifetime of the batteries. Well defined nanocrystals of LiCoO<sub>2</sub> can be synthesized and subsequnetly tested for battery performance. The figure below shows a schematic of the nanocrystals synthesized at UIC. With this information we can model the individual facets of the nanocrystal and study the effect on EC adsorption metal dopants will have in each region.

Using this information we plan a way to look at specific surface facets and the interactions of these facets with EC. The metals we will look at are Ni, Mg, an Ti. [Data for non-doped LiCoO<sub>2</sub> and Al-doped LiCoO<sub>2</sub> will provided for reference.]((../CompData)

## Calculations ##

To get started we need to get the files needed for the final project. Move into your CBE544 directory and run these commands:

```bash
cd
cd CBE544
wget https://cbe544.github.io/CBE544-2019.github.io/FinalProject.tar.gz
tar -zxvf FinalProject.tar.gz

```

In the FinalProject directory you should see some trajectory files and a directory called scripts which contains the scripts you will need for this project. In `FinalProject` directory create driectory for the surface facet (104 or 001) and in that for the metal and locations you are runnig a `M-surf` and/or `M-subsurf` folder (M is the metal you are assigned, please check [Assignment](https://cbe544.github.io/Project_Assignments/)). For example, if you are assignemnt with Ni and you are running a surface calculation, please run the following command to create the directories: 

```bash
cd FinalProject
mkidr 104
cd 104
mkdir Ni-surf
```

Organization for the project is very important so that the data is accesbile once the class is over. We will structure is to be something like this for the 104 surface

```bash
~/CBE544/FinalProject/104/M-surf/noads/
~/CBE544/FinalProject/104/M-surf/ads1/
~/CBE544/FinalProject/104/M-surf/ads2/
~/CBE544/FinalProject/104/M-surf/ads3/
~/CBE544/FinalProject/104/M-surf/noads/bader
~/CBE544/FinalProject/104/M-surf/ads1/bader
~/CBE544/FinalProject/104/M-surf/ads2/bader
~/CBE544/FinalProject/104/M-surf/ads3/bader
~/CBE544/FinalProject/104/M-sub/noads/
~/CBE544/FinalProject/104/M-sub/ads1/
~/CBE544/FinalProject/104/M-sub/ads2/
~/CBE544/FinalProject/104/M-sub/ads3/
~/CBE544/FinalProject/104/M-sub/noads/bader
~/CBE544/FinalProject/104/M-sub/ads1/bader
~/CBE544/FinalProject/104/M-sub/ads2/bader
~/CBE544/FinalProject/104/M-sub/ads3/bader
```
This is an outline of all of the DFT calculations you will need to do, how to organize the files, and where to run each calculation. For the 001 surface it should be something like this:

```bash
~/CBE544/FinalProject/001/CoTerm/noads/
~/CBE544/FinalProject/001/CoTerm/ads1/
~/CBE544/FinalProject/001/CoTerm/ads2/
~/CBE544/FinalProject/001/CoTerm/ads3/
~/CBE544/FinalProject/001/CoTerm/noads/bader
~/CBE544/FinalProject/001/CoTerm/ads1/bader
~/CBE544/FinalProject/001/CoTerm/ads2/bader
~/CBE544/FinalProject/001/CoTerm/ads3/bader
~/CBE544/FinalProject/001/Literm/noads/
~/CBE544/FinalProject/001/Literm/ads1/
~/CBE544/FinalProject/001/Literm/ads2/
~/CBE544/FinalProject/001/Literm/ads3/
~/CBE544/FinalProject/001/Literm/noads/bader
~/CBE544/FinalProject/001/Literm/ads1/bader
~/CBE544/FinalProject/001/Literm/ads2/bader
~/CBE544/FinalProject/001/Literm/ads3/bader
```

Not everyone will be running on calculations so you only need to have the directories of the calculations you will be running.

#### A note on Magnetism ###
These calculations are spin polarized and therefore the atoms contain non-zero magnetic moments. In order to view these magnetic moments, which are important for consistent calculations, you can open the final trajectory in ase-gui -> View -> Show Labels -> Magnetic Moments. The problem here is the the ase-gui for ase/3.13.0 does not do a good job with making the magnetic moments readable in the image BUT ase/3.9.1 does. This is further complicated by the fact that we cannot open trajecotry files made in ase/3.13.0 in ase/3.9.1 so we must convert from ase/3.13.0 to ase/3.9.1. We can do this using the switch.py script. Specifically, move into the direcotry where you wish to write the final trajectory to an ase/3.9.1 trajectory file and run these commands:

```bash
module load ase/3.9.1
python ~/CBE544/FinalProject/switch.py
```
This will write a file called `mag.traj` which will be openable in ase/3.9.1 and contain the structure and magnetic moments from your caclulation. When presenting structures please include the magnetic moments in your images. This script only works for final trajectories and not for bader charges files.

#### Jobs Not Running on Chestnut ####

As with the HW there are specific pairings of nodes that will not run calculations on chestnut. I have provided a script so that you can check to see if you jobs are running. 

```bash
sh ~/CBE544/FinalProject/mummyjobs.sh
```

Running this command will check on the jobs that are currently running to ensure that they are generating an output. If you run this script and no other lines are printed then your jobs are OK. If you get a results it means that you must cancel your job,exclude some nodes (this is explained in the HW5 page), and resubmit. 

#### Jobs not reaching force convergence ####

Some jobs have been running on chestnut and have not reached the force convergence. This means we must extend the job and continue the calculation. I have written a script that will automatically extend the calculation you will just need to copy this by doing :

```bash
cp /home/antcurto/for/CBE544/extend.sh ~/CBE544/FinalProject/scripts
```
If you have a job that ended with convergence you can uses this script by typing:

```bash
sh ~/CBE544/FinalProject/extend.sh
```

This will make a new directory, copy in some files and submit a new job to be run from where the previous calculation has left off. Please only use this if you need to  


### Task 1: ### 

Once you have accurately completed HW5 you can continue on to the final project. We will use the 104 surface and 001 surface trajectories provided to you in the FinalProject directory (this is only because there are specific starting magnetic strcutrures that we want otherwise the structures that you made could be used) to place a metal dopant on the surface and subsurface (separately, so two total calculations). The locations are shown here as in a top view of the 104 surface. The simplest way to change an atom to the desired dopant is to use ase-gui, click on the atom to change, Edit (or ctrl+Y), and type in the element you want. Be sure to save this new trejactory because ase-gui does not automatically save any changes you make.

104 Dopant Locations
</center>

Once you have substitued the metal dopant you can use the relax.py script in ~/CBE544/FinalProject/scripts to relax this system. Copy over the script and submit the job. Record the final energies which can be used to determine if the preferred dopant location is surface or subsurface.

### Task 2: ### 
Using these models from Task 1 we can now adsorb EC to the three locations (per system) shown below:

<center><img src="../Images/Adsorptionlocations104.png" alt="window" style="width: 800px;"/><br>
Locations for Adsorption on the 104 surface of LiCoO<sub>2</sub>
</center>

Refer to the [Adsorption page](../ASE/Adsorption) for instructions on how to add the EC adsorbate. We will use a different script than the relax.py for adsorption DFT calculations. We will use the script called opt-ads.py which you can find in `FinalProject/scripts`. Please be sure to use this script for these calculations or you may expereince converngence issues. 

### Task 3: ### 

Once you have converged the systems with and without EC we will do a [bader charge analysis](http://theory.cm.utexas.edu/henkelman/code/bader/).  Inside the directory where your calculations were run make a new directory called bader (by doing `mkdir bader`). Copy into this directory  fin.traj and vasp-ase.sub. Rename your fin.traj to init.traj (`mv fin.traj init.traj`). Copy from the `FinalProject/scripts` directory the badercharge.py script. It will look like this:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
from ase import Atoms, Atom
from ase.calculators.vasp import Vasp
from ase.io import read,write
import numpy as np

p=read('init.traj')
calc = Vasp(prec='accurate',
            encut=520,
            xc='PBE',
            lreal='Auto',
            kpts=[4,4,1],
            nsw = 0,
            ibrion = -1,
            ispin = 2,
            amix_mag = 0.800000,
            bmix = 0.000100,
            bmix_mag= 0.000100,
            amix = 0.20000,
            sigma = 0.05000,
            ediff = 2.00e-04,
            ediffg = -2.00e-02,
            algo ='fast',
            ismear = -5,
            nelm = 250,
            ncore = 16,
            lasph= True,
            ldautype = 2,
            lmaxmix = 4,
            lorbit = 11,
            ldau = True,
            ldauprint = 2,
            ldau_luj={'Co':{'L':2, 'U':3.32, 'J':0},
                      'Li':{'L':-1, 'U':0.0, 'J':0.0},
                      'O':{'L':-1, 'U':0.0, 'J':0.0}
                      },
            lvtot = False,
            lwave = False,
            lcharg = True,
	    laechg= True,
	    gamma=True,
)
calc.calculation_required = lambda x, y: True
p.set_calculator(calc)
pe=p.get_potential_energy()
#####
ana =  Vasp(restart=True)
pend = ana.get_atoms()

forces=pend.get_forces().ravel()
max_force=max([abs(x) for x in forces])

pe = pend.get_potential_energy()
#mag = pend.get_magnetic_moments()

#pend.set_initial_magnetic_moments(mag)
#print mag
write('fin.traj',pend)
```
This script does a static calculation (nsw=0) of the final trajectory from your previous relaxation and writes the files needed to do a bader charge anaylsis. Use the vasp-ase.sub script to submit the badercharge.py script (`sbatch vasp-ase.sub` with the final line `python badercharge.py`). Once the job has finished you will need an updated bader_get_charge_vasp script. To do this do:

```bash
cp /home/antcurto/for/CBE544/bader_get_charge_vasp ~/CBE544/FinalProject/scripts
```

Next you can attach the bader charge to each atom by typing

```bash
module load ase/3.9.1
python ~/CBE544/FinalProject/scripts/bader_get_charge_vasp
```
This will write a new trajectory file called bader_charge.traj that has attached the bader charge of each atom as a magnetic moment. To see this use ase-gui -> View -> Show Labels -> Magnetic Moments. Analyze how the bader charges differ from each system. It is important to load ase/3.9.1 so that the magnetic moments are readable.

### Task 4: ###

Repeat both Task 1 and Task 2 for the 001 surface. The only difference is instead of surface and subsurface we will use Li-terminated vs CoO termianted. You can use the trajectories in the FinalProject directory to run the substituion calculations but we will be doing the adsorption calculations slightly different than the 104. 

Since the calculation for 001 take a long time you will be provided with two trajectories with EC absorbed to the surface already. From here we will alter or dopant location to see the effect of the dopant location within proximity to the adsorbate. To get the trajectories (which are clean LiCoO<sub>2</sub>) type this:

```bash
cp /home/antcurto/for/CBE544/001-Cotermwithads.traj ~/CBE544/FinalProject  
cp /home/antcurto/for/CBE544/001-Litermwithads.traj ~/CBE544/FinalProject
```
This will give you the trajectories with EC adsorbed. The location of where to substitute Co with your dopant can be seen below.

</center>
<center><img src="../Images/dopantlocation001Li.png" alt="window" style="width: 800px;"/><br>
001 Li terminated Dopant Locations
</center>


Run a bader charge analysis on this system as well. See if there are any clear trends between the two systems through things such as dopant location, charge, etc. [Compare your system to the LiCoO<sub>2</sub> and the Al-doped system shown on this page](../CompData). Look for trends between these systems, your own system, and even those of your classmates (if possible)

<a name='deadlines'></a>

## Deadlines ##
1. HW5 Due: Wed 10 April (Each student)
2. Short update (few slides) on completed calcualtions: Wed 17 April during class (1 per group)
3. Final Presentation: Wed 1 May during class (1 per group)
4. Final Paper: Wed 8 May by 5 PM (1 per group)

## Analysis ##

Do an detailed analysis of your system trying to identifty trends in adsorption due to dopant location, charge, surface, or anything else. Compare your data to that of plain LiCoO<sub>2</sub> and Al-doped LiCoO<sub>2</sub> which can be found [here](../CompData).

### Requirements ###

At a minimum you should accomplish the following:

1. Complete the [HW5](../ASE/Getting_Started).
2. Setup a LiCoO<sub>2</sub> surface (104) and calculate adsorption energies for EC adsorption at three sites for two different metal dopant locations (surface and sub-surface).
3. Do a Bader Charge Analysis on metal doped system and metal doped system w/ EC absorbed (8 total bader charge calculations) and compare to the provided systems without a dopant and with an Al dopant.
4. Repeat this process on the 001 facet. Instead of doing is for surface and subsurface we will do this for Li-terminated and CoO<sub>2</sub> terminated. 
5. Analysis
    1. Does the dopant have a strong preference for surface vs subsurface?
    2. How does the metal dopant affect adsorption vs plain LiCoO<sub>2</sub>? vs Al-doped? How is the adosrption different for surface vs sub-surface? 
    3. Do you notice and trends from the bader charge analysis that may contribute to the change in adsorption? Look at different site and different facet terminations.
6. Report (3~5 pages maximum)

### Presentation ##

The Final Presentation should include a summary of all of the calculations you were able to complete. Present the strucutres (with magnetic moments shown please), adsorption energies, and bader charges. You will present that data and an analysis of this data compared to the provided LiCoO<sub>2</sub> and the Al-doped LiCoO<sub>2</sub> data. Also take note of ay major strucutral changes induced by the dopants. Use the structure and magnetism images shown [here](../MagStruct), the 104-LiCoO2.traj and 001-Literm.traj, and the data [here](../CompData) provided to you for some geometric anaylsis.

Discuss problems you had with convergence, magnetism, or any other problems that you encounctered. 

Each Group will also be required to ask questions and begin a disucssion about another groups work. Here are those assignments:

Ni group will ask Ti group questions.<br>
Ti group will ask Mg group questions.<br>
Mg group will ask Ni group questions.

<a name='report'></a>
